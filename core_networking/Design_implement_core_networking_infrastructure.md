# Design and implement core networking infrastructure

## Virtual networks in Azure

- A VNet must exist within a single subscription and within a single region
- A resource can only be created in a virtual network that exists in the same region and subscription as the resource. You can, however, connect virtual networks that exist in different subscriptions and regions.
- You can deploy as many virtual networks as you need within each subscription, up to the subscription limit
- All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet by default
- **Layer 3**
  - It understands IP addresses
  - TCP
  - UDP
  - Cannot do broadcast or multicast
- When creating a VNet, itâ€™s recommended that you use the address ranges enumerated in **RFC 1918** which have been set aside for private, non-routable address spaces
  - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
  - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
  - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
- The following address ranges cannot be used:
  - 224.0.0.0/4 (Multicast)
  - 255.255.255.255/32 (Broadcast)
  - 127.0.0.0/8 (Loopback)
  - 169.254.0.0/16 (Link-local)
  - 168.63.129.16/32 (Internal DNS)
- **Azure reserves the first 4 and last IP addresses within each subnet.**
- For example, the IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:
  - 192.168.1.0: Network address
  - 192.168.1.1: Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
  - 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3: Reserved by Azure to map the DNS IPs to the VNet space
  - 192.168.1.255: Network broadcast address
- When planning to implement virtual networks, you need to consider the following:
  - Ensure non-overlapping address spaces. Ensure your VNet address space (CIDR block) does not overlap with your organization's other network ranges.
  - Is any security isolation required?
  - Do you need to mitigate any IP addressing limitations?
  - Will there be connections between Azure VNets and on-premises networks?
  - Is there any isolation required for administrative purposes?
  - Are you using any Azure services that create their own VNets?
- **Service tags**
  - a group of IP address prefixes from a given Azure service
  - Microsoft manages these exclusively and publishes them weekly
  - Used for on-premises connections and NSGs
  - Read-only

## Virtual network peering

- Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more virtual networks in Azure
- The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure
- Two types of peering
  - **Virtual network peering**: connects virtual networks within the same Azure region
  - **Global virtual network peering**: connects virtual networks across Azure regions
- Virtual network peering **is NOT transitive** by default. You have to build the routing paths yourself. In the image below, VNet A wouldnâ€™t be able to communicate with VNet B by default.

## Private endpoints

- A private endpoint is a network interface associated with a specific Azure data resource that uses a **private IP address** from your virtual network
- This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service thatâ€™s powered by Azure Private Link
- The resource can be accessed over peered networks and hybrid cloud connections
- It offers the same solution as the service endpoint, but whereas with service endpoints the resources are still accessible over the internet, with private endpoints the resource arenâ€™t available over the internet

## Subnets

- A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the VNet.
- You can segment VNets into different size subnets, creating as many subnets as you require for organization and security purposes within the subscription limit.
- Like in a traditional network, subnets allow you to segment your VNet address space into segments that are appropriate for the organization's internal network. This also improves address allocation efficiency.
- The smallest supported IPv4 subnet is /29, and the largest is /2 (using CIDR subnet definitions). IPv6 subnets must be exactly /64 in size.
- Each subnet must have a unique address range, specified in CIDR
- Certain Azure services require their own subnet
  - **Virtual network gateways** require a dedicated subnet specifically named *GatewaySubnet*. Its size must be at least a /29 in CIDR notation. It is recommended, however, that a larger address space be assigned, such as /27.
  - **Azure Firewall** requires a subnet specifically named *AzureFirewallSubnet*, with a recommended size of /26.
  - **Azure Application Gateway** requires a dedicated subnet within the virtual network, but it doesnâ€™t need to have a specific name. The subnet must be empty, and not contain any Azure resources. The recommended size of the subnet will depend on the SKU chosen.
  - **Bastion** requires a dedicated subnet specifically named *AzureBastionSubnet*, with a prefix of at least /27.
  - **Azure Route Server** is a service that simplifies the routing for hybrid connectivity and requires a dedicated subnet with a specific name of *RouteServerSubnet* and a minimum size of /27.

## Name resolution

### Public DNS zones

- Azure DNS is a PaaS service that provides an authoritative DNS service for a domain name in your environment.
- The domain name should be a public domain that you can configure the name servers.
- DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azureâ€™s global network of name servers.
- A DNS Zone hosts the DNS records for a domain.
- To delegate your domain to Azure DNS, you first need to know the name server names for your zone. Each time a DNS zone is created, Azure DNS allocates name servers from a pool. Once the Name Servers are assigned, Azure DNS automatically creates authoritative NS records in your zone.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Azure isnâ€™t the domain registrar. You are just delegating your public zone for Azure to manage it.
</aside>

### Private DNS services

- Private DNS services resolve names and IP addresses for resources and services available from our own internal networks.
- The records contained in a private DNS zone arenâ€™t resolvable from the internet. DNS resolution against a private DNS zone works only from virtual networks that are linked to it.
- You can link a private DNS zone to one or more virtual networks by creating virtual network links
- You can enable the **autoregistration** feature to automatically manage the life cycle of the DNS records for the virtual machines that get deployed in a virtual network.
